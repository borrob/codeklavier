# Code Klavier
programming with the piano as interface

An open-source project of Felipe Ignacio Noriega & Anne Veinberg 

The codeklavier development adventure has just begun (March-April 2017). This is a 'hello world' and more information will be added soon. 

The dream                              ->        a programming language for music as interface
The starting-to-be-graspable dream     ->        a programming language for the piano as interface
The long term goal                     ->        a live coding music-domain programming language for the piano as interface
The mid term goal                      ->        strategy-specific releases of mini-language approaches for live coding          through the piano
The short term goal                    ->        research-release-evaluation cycles of prototypes which takle specific aspects of the system
