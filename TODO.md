#### Place your Requests here ####
- a sweep for clusters
- reset all variables -> DONE
- make toypiano sampler in SuperCollider  -> DONE
- the SC sampler shoots error now when i go ~down where the one note is below range. Do you like the way this looks? It just messed up the post script. Also, when I go too fast I get a lots of errors in post script...
- Now i've lost the bottom Ab. Can you readd it so ~h10=0-1 will work. Thanks
